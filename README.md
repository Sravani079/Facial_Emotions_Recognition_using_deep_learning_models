# Facial_Emotions_Recognition_using_deep_learning_models
# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Facial Emotion Recognition System that identifies emotions from facial expressions in images. The system utilizes deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify facial expressions into one of seven categories: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Neutral.

# Objectives:
Improve facial emotion recognition performance by addressing challenges like class imbalance, misclassifications, and training data inconsistencies.
Implement test-time augmentation to enhance model robustness and accuracy.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model convergence.

# Methodology
Dataset Loading: Use the FER 2013 dataset for training and testing.
Data Preprocessing: Apply data augmentation (rotation, zoom) and normalize pixel values. Use class balancing techniques.
Model Creation: Implement a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers and dropout for regularization.
Model Training: Train the model with an adaptive learning rate and batch size, utilizing transfer learning (e.g., VGG16).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Test-Time Augmentation: Apply test-time augmentation by generating multiple samples per image and averaging predictions.

# Database
FER 2013 Dataset: A collection of 35,887 labeled facial images representing 7 emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral. The images are 48x48 grayscale and were originally collected from the web for emotion recognition tasks.

# Performance
The model showed promising performance in recognizing facial expressions, with improvements observed through:

Test-Time Augmentation: Increased model robustness.
Class Balancing: Addressed class imbalance and reduced misclassification rates, especially in underrepresented classes like Neutral and Sadness.

# Conclusion
The facial emotion recognition model has shown strong performance with the FER 2013 dataset, utilizing techniques like data augmentation, weighted loss functions, and test-time augmentation. These methods helped improve the model's accuracy and robustness, making it adaptable to real-world scenarios.

# Limitations
Complex Emotions: Some mixed or subtle emotions are hard to classify.
Class Imbalance: Some emotions are underrepresented in the dataset, leading to biased performance.
Image Quality: Low-quality or noisy images can reduce model accuracy.
